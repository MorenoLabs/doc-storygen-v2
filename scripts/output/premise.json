    "premise": " In the quiet, sun-dappled town of Everbrook, James Clarkson, a middle-aged librarian with a penchant for ancient artifacts, stumbles upon a peculiar, worn-out ring during one of his solitary weekend hikes. Intrigued by the cryptic inscriptions etched into the band, he slips it onto his finger, only to experience an overwhelming rush of memories, whispers of an age-old legend. As the visions fade, he comprehends that this ring grants the extraordinary power to turn back time by precisely ten seconds\u2014no more, no less. But it can only be used once."
